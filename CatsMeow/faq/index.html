                    <p class="questions">Q: What is waxing, and how does it work?</p>
                    <p> 
                        Waxing is a hair removal method that involves applying 
                        a warm or cold wax to the skin and then quickly pulling it off, along with the unwanted hair. 
                        The wax adheres to the hair, allowing for smooth and long-lasting results. 
                        In my studio, I use both hard wax (a stripless wax that adheres to the hair 
                        only and not the skin) and soft wax (used with strips to remove). 
                        Both serve their purpose in obtaining the most thorough wax service
                        depending on what they’re needed for. I do prefer to use hard wax for
                        intimate and sensitive areas, like intimate waxing,  underarms, 
                        and most facial waxing.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="questions">Q: Does waxing hurt?</p >
                    <p>
                        Waxing may cause some discomfort, as hair is removed from the root. 
                        Each client is different for what their pain tolerance is. 
                        However, I try my best  to get the job done as quickly as possible.
                        I am skilled at minimizing discomfort, and if this is your first wax then 
                        I normally take extra time to walk you through it. With consecutive waxing 
                        appointments the pain sensation typically lessens with each session  due to
                        the hair being less dense and the hair roots being weakened with each wax. 
                    </p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="questions">Q: How long does waxing last?</p >
                    <p>
                        Waxing can provide hair-free results for around 3 to 6 weeks, 
                        depending on individual hair growth rates. 
                        Regular waxing can lead to finer and less noticeable hair. 
                        There are four different hair growth cycles~ we focus on the 
                        first three with your first initial wax. I will be removing cycles 2 and 3. 
                        Cycle one will be just underneath the skin’s surface, or just starting to 
                        grow and will be too short for the wax to grab. 
                        These are the hairs that will show up usually within 5 to 10 days 
                        after your wax depending on the person's hair cycle. With each consecutive wax, 
                        we will try to get all three cycles as close as possible, making your waxing 
                        results last longer each time. it normally takes three to five consecutive 
                        waxes ( usually scheduled 3 to 5 weeks apart) to find each client’s perfect 
                        waxing schedule.

                    <p>Anywhere there is hair can be waxed. I offer full-body waxing and specialize in Brazilian waxing.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="questions">Q: How long should hair be for waxing?</p >
                    <p>
                        For effective waxing, hair should ideally be about 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. 
                        The size of a long grain of rice. If your hair is extra long, 
                        you should leave the trimming to me so you don’t cut them too short. 
                        Avoid shaving for at least two weeks before your waxing appointment. 
                        Be at least 3-4 weeks out from your last wax when scheduling your wax appt.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="questions">Q: Can I wax if I have sensitive skin?</p >
                    <p>
                        Yes, you can wax if you have sensitive skin. 
                        I carry multiple hypoallergenic waxes and have techniques 
                        to minimize irritation. I take full precautions to thoroughly 
                        examine your skin before I start any waxing service.

                    <p class="questions">Q: Can I wax if I'm pregnant?</p >
                    <p>
                        Waxing is generally safe during pregnancy, 
                        but your pain tolerance and skin sensitivities might vary due to 
                        hormonal changes. Consult your healthcare provider before any beauty 
                        treatment during pregnancy.

                    <p class="questions">Q: What types of wax are used?</p >
                    <p>
                        We use two main types of wax: soft wax (strip wax) and hard wax (stripless wax). 
                        Soft wax is applied and removed using cloth strips, while hard wax hardens 
                        and is removed directly without strips. I carry hypoallergenic waxes in both 
                        wax types from multiple brands.. I will use the wax that does the best job to 
                        get all the hair gone.

                    <p class="questions">Q: How can I prevent ingrown hairs?</p >
                    <p>
                        I am going to sound like a broken record, but exfoliation and moisturizing is 
                        really all it takes to prevent them besides avoiding some no-nos.  
                        I always say this is an uneven partnership because my part is only 30- more 
                        like 25% my part; and the other is 70/75% you and your wax aftercare homework. 
                        With each wax the hairs get finer and weaker; they also take longer to grow 
                        back which means if you are not exfoliating, then the dead skin cells are 
                        building up making it much harder for the hair to come out on the surface 
                        causing an ingrown. If your waxed area becomes itchy, 
                        that is your skin telling you that you need to exfoliate it!! 
                        Regular exfoliation and keeping the skin moisturized with proper after-wax 
                        products can help prevent ingrown hairs. Also, avoid tight clothing, excessive 
                        sweating, and sexual activity immediately after waxing. Sweat and friction are 
                        fresh waxed skin’s worst enemy!

                    <p class="questions">Q: How long should I avoid sun exposure after waxing?</p >
                    <p>
                        It's recommended to avoid sun exposure for at least 48 hours after waxing, 
                        as waxed skin can be more sensitive to UV rays. 
                        I also will not wax sunburnt or freshly sun-damaged skin.
                    </p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="questions">Q: Can I wax if I'm using skincare products like retinoids?</p >
                    <p>
                        Using retinoids or other exfoliating skincare products can make your skin thinner, 
                        more sensitive, and prone to irritation and LIFTING!! Waxing while on these 
                        products will take off the top layer of your skin (lifting). 
                        It's best to stop these products at least 7-10 days before waxing if on 
                        prescription grade and 3-5 days if you use over-the-counter products.

                    <p class="questions">Q: How often should I wax to maintain results?</p >
                    <p>
                        Most people wax every 4 to 6 weeks to maintain hair-free results, 
                        as this corresponds to the typical hair growth cycle. 
                        But each person’s hair growth cycle is individual and I will work with 
                        you the best time and schedule to maintain yours.

                        It's important to inform me about ANY medical conditions, 
                        allergies, or medications you're taking. Some conditions and medications

                        bikini wax removes hair from the bikini line area not the back area, 
                        while a Brazilian wax removes hair from the front, back, and everything in
                        between, and the option of leaving a thin strip or triangle if desired.

                    <p class="questions">Q: How do I prepare for a waxing appointment?</p>
                    <p>
                        Exfoliate gently a day before your appointment, 
                        wear loose clothing to avoid friction afterward, 
                        and avoid caffeine to help reduce skin sensitivity. 
                        Be showered, but do not moisturize after. 
                        Take an over-the-counter pain reliever (with your doctor’s permission) 
                        if you think it will help take the edge off the sting. Body waxing is not 
                        the most painful thing. Is it fun? Not really, but it is tolerable. 
                        It's not the worst thing ever, but the results will make you come back again 
                        for it.
